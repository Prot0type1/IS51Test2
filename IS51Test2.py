"""
Three catagories of grades will be displayed by this program. These will be the 
number of grades, average of the grades and the percentages of grades. All three categories will be calulated by 
retriving the students grades first.

Then the program will calculate the percentage of grades above averaging them.

This will display the number of grades & the 
average grades & the percentages of grades that are above the average.
